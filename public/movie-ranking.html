<h1>The Best Movies According to Gopal</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h2>The Lunch Box</h2>
<p>
    This movie is lead by the veteran actor Irfan Khan and Nawazudhhin Sidique.<br/> 
    One of the best movie I have ever seen in my life. The kind of story telling,<br/> 
    acting and cast are there, It worthy enough to watch multiple times as well.
</p>
<h2>Piku</h2>
<p>
    This movie is lead by Big B, Irfan and Deepika.<br/> 
    One of the very entertening, romantic and commedy movie.<br/> 
    This will comes under all time great romcom movie in my watch list.
</p>
<h2>Monica O' my darling</h2>
<p>
    One of the best commedy-thriller movie along with its casting, story telling and acting.<br/> 
    The background music will be much better than highly rated movie in bollywood.<br/> 
    The way Raj and Radhika Apte acted in this movie is hilarious to watch.</p>
